Title: Pocket is shutting down. I vibe coded a free open-source alternative

Hey folks,

When I heard Pocket was shutting down, I spent 10 days coding an alternative: https://jaib.waliddib.com

It's completely free and open source. Main features:

- PWA that works across all devices
- Clean reading view that strips away clutter
- Annotations and highlights
- Batch import from Pocket (CSV export)
- Article search and sorting
- Tagging system
- Chrome extension (Firefox coming soon)
- Text-to-speech powered by Kokoro

The source code is available if you want to self-host. I'm currently covering the TTS server costs (running on RunPod), which is getting a bit expensive as more people use it. I might add a premium tier later for unlimited TTS, automatic article tagging, offline viewing, and full-text search if there's interest.

For now though, the core features are free and will stay that way. I built this because I needed it, figured others might too.

Let me know what you think or if you have any questions about setting it up yourself.
